 PAMN 24/25

Notes:
_Current location update is happening only in the moment when app is opened. If it is already opened and the location changes you have to close the app and open it again;
_Sometimes you need to wait some seconds for the location to be updated correctly;
_"currentLocation" variable deleted because "location" variable makes it useless ("location" is updated automatically
 and is not modified by the user);
_In the homepage we could just show user position in a map without the necessity to have the exact city written somewhere;
_We have to write the presentation document for the app;
_I created some test users (u can see them in firestore):
    -Nicol√≤, location:
    -Yannick, location:
    -Ludovica, location:
    -Katja, location:
    -Alexandra, location:
    -Agata, location:

To do:
_Gestione di photoUrl:
    -nelle liste di utenti devono comparire le foto profilo;
